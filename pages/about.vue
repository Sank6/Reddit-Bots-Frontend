      This is an automatically generated and ever expanding list of Reddit bots
      so users can find a bot that suits their needs.

        All the users on this list are generated through a points based
        algorithm, somewhat similar to
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/botwatch/comments/1wg6f6">
          u/Plague_Bot </a
        >'s tool.

        This means that some users, especially moderators, tend to get flagged
        as bots. If you spot a user, please report them and I will eventually
        delete them.

      <p>
        If your bot is on this list and you want it removed, login as the bot
        and report it or

        When you login with Reddit, we store your user information for that
        session. All the data gets deleted as soon as you logout. However,
        reporting a bot does send your username, which will get stored along
        with the report. No other personal data is stored.
